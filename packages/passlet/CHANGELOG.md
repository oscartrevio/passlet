## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 073283e: Fix Google Wallet class updates rejecting with `Invalid review status Optional[APPROVED]` or `Review status must be set`. The class update now properly merges the existing remote class using a `PUT` request and normalizes the `reviewStatus` attribute to `UNDER_REVIEW`.
- aecdd26: Fix Google Wallet hero image and class update behavior

  - **Banner ImageSet support**: when `banner` is passed as an `ImageSet` object (`{ base, retina, superRetina }`), the Google provider now correctly uses the `base` URL as the `heroImage`. Previously only plain string URLs were picked up; an `ImageSet` with a URL base was silently dropped.

  - **Class upsert**: `create()` now updates the Google Wallet class body (colors, images, names) on every call instead of no-op-ing when the class already exists. `reviewStatus` is intentionally excluded from the update so approved classes are never demoted.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- b65596d: fix: omit barcode altText when not

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 8b9cd75: Throw `GOOGLE_MISSING_LOGO` before hitting the Google API when a loyalty pass has no logo. Previously the library would make the API call and surface a cryptic 400 response; now it fails fast with a clear `WalletError`.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- be02c8b: bump deps

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 6c36400: Fix zod catalog specifier for npm compatibility, surface upstream detail in Google API errors

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a83e16d: Initial release. Generate Apple Wallet and Google Wallet passes from a single TypeScript API.
